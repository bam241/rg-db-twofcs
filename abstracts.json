Calculation was done as if the blankets were producing 100% of the power of the reactor when they usually produce less than 10%. This errors multiplies by more than ten the need for blanket fuel fabrication and reprocessing which has a very adverse effect on the global economic equation of Fast Breeder Aeactors. The authors made their most important calculation sheets available on the internet which allows transparency and the reproduction and the correction of the results. We will present corrected versions of the key figures of the report together with some alternative conclusions. This error demonstrates the needs for open benchmarks and active forums where experts can check the robustness of their interdisciplinary tools. It also demonstrates that the debate about the opportunity of advanced fuel cycle is much more open than that report demonstrated.This refocuses the debate on the key technical-economics assumptions in favor of the different options. What is the cost-benefit analysis of blankets in SFR ? Is uranium price or visibility of its potential reduced availability of any relevance to the debate ?

Those uncertainties might have a strong impact on some output quantities such as inventories compositions, plutonium/waste masses. This paper aims at testing an uncertainties and sensitivities method that should be used for robust studies applied to scenarios framework.\nThe proposed approach starts by selecting parameters, defining uncertainties models (Gaussian, uniform...) and variation ranges. The results of the uncertainty propagation also depend on the evaluated quantities of interest, therefore the observables on which the impact will be estimated must be selected. Once this setup is defined, the next step is to apply a screening method (Morris design) to evaluate the significance and interactivity of parameters on the results. This allows evaluating independent parameters apart. Finally, a sensitivity study based on the evaluation of Sobol indices is applied on the remaining parameters for deeper analyse.\nThe Dynamic fuel cycle simulation tool used for this illustration is CLASS (Core Library for Advance Scenario Simulation) [1, 2], which is an open source package of C++ libraries developed by CNRS in collaboration with IRSN.

They often constitutes a large part of future nuclear reactor fleets, sometimes up to 100%. It is thus important to include model for these reactors in our codes. However the deployment of SFRs at the industrial scale has not started yet and concept are not completely fixed. A wide range of design are still currently studied, some are at a more advanced technology readiness level and seems to  be more close to industrial reactors, but no consensus yet on one of them.\nTo conclude about the scenarios including these reactor concepts we need models inside our scenario codes, models precises enough to render to sensitivity of isotopes' inventories to changes of designs and/or fuel cycle. Creating one model for each design and then testing all scenarios with all models would be  unnecessarily  time consuming considering how far most sodium fast reactors concepts are from industrial technology readiness levels.\nTo avoid this problem while still providing a model precise enough to be able to conclude on the scenarios involving SFRs, we choose to develop a single, physics-based, flexible model able to represent a wide range of SFR designs. In  this flexible model many design parameters, such as the radius or the height of the active core or the fertile blankets, are not fixed but can be chosen during scenario definition in order to adapt the SFR design in each scenario while still using the unique model.\nThe model is integrated in the CLASS scenario simulation tool[1] and is based on neural networks able to feed the two main CLASS sub-models that are the cross-section predictor and the fuel building method. For the cross-section predictor, cross-section for a large collection of SFR depletion that are representative of the whole range of simulated designs are needed. For  the fuel building method, even in breeder reactor, and due to the difficulty to control reactivity in SFR, the evolution of K during depletion is the limiting factor for choosing what material to put in your fuel. Therefor we need also to be able to predict k evolution for the whole collection of SFR designs.\nThe influence of a wide range of parameters and modeling choices on the cross-sections and the k have been investigated and only most  significant parameters are used for the final simulations.\nBecause the construction of a training base for neural network needs a big number of point, we used also these calculations to simplify as much as possible the model use for neural network training without sacrificing behavior rendering and precision.\nUsing these parameter selection as a training base for the neural networks, a model is created and included in the scenario code CLASS.

Many of these studies were performed within the framework of established international organizations or organized as an ad hoc study with voluntary contributions from participants. These studies achieved different levels of agreement depending on the scenarios analyzed and values compared, varying from excellent agreement in annual mass flows and inventories to general agreement in terms of trends. Since validation is challenging for these types of codes, these comparison studies helped develop confidence in the results from these forecasting codes. In addition, many of these codes were developed independently with limited feedback due to the lack of a widely-established user base. Therefore, such studies are also great opportunities for the developers and users to calibrate interpretations as well as modify/debug the codes themselves.\n\nHowever, in almost all of these benchmarks and code comparisons, the same challenges and discrepancies keep re-appearing, and may continue to be \u201cre-discovered\u201d through future benchmarks.

Certain models track individual fuel batches through individual reactors using embedded neutronics calculations to closely estimate isotopic mass flows in time.  While others simply assume that reactors of a given type have fixed-isotopic input and output fuel recipes.  Most fall somewhere in between; it is also common for powerful codes to be applied simply at first for fast scoping calculations, with advanced features reserved for later application to the more promising options.\nA recent series of analyses using the VISION fuel cycle model followed such an arc.  The initial scenario to be examined relied on an equilibrium fuel recipe at a pre-calculated end-state, requiring very little sophistication.  Later scenarios examined the transition to the end state from an assumed starting point.  The first calculations required only the existing ability to evolve between similar fuel recipes.  However, later transitions looked at swapping out breeder reactor driver, blanket, and reflector assemblies to vary the breeding ratio.  This introduced large changes in core mass and irradiation time parameters, which VISION was unable to handle.  To compute this scenario, changes were made to the reactor fuel management module to increase its flexibility.  Instead of tracking mass, this new model tracks the integer number of reactors having fuel at 1) a given point burn-up, 2) the pass index of the fuel, and 3) the fuel recipe vintage (where vintage refers to either the Current or Previous recipe).  When the recipe for a reactor changed, the previously loaded inventory is transferred over from the Current vintage to the Previous.  The previous recipe fuel is then prioritized for discharge ahead of the newer material, ensuring a timely transition.  This allows the recipe transition to occur without requiring a complete restart of the affected reactor fleet.\nAnother common challenge is that of adapting existing models to unforeseen situations.  For example, while the continuous fuel flow of the VISION fleet-averaged model would be readily adaptable to the continuous refueling of a Pebble Bed Reactor, it would be quite a different undertaking to model a Molten Salt Reactor.  In the former case, the constant rate of new fuel addition and old fuel discharge would be well matched to the existing constant-flow approximations.  However, in the latter case, the requirement that fuel pass through finite cooling, processing, and fabrication stages would introduce an unavoidable logical delay.  While shortening the timestep might improve the fidelity of the calculations, it would do so at a large computational cost.  Other work-arounds may be possible, but their impacts to scenario fidelity must be carefully assessed prior to deployment.", "timestamp": "4/25/2017 11:45:35", "title": "Fuel Composition Transition Modeling"}

Classical code comparisons and benchmarks have generally suffered from an inability to compare results between  simulators due to differences in modeling choices and output data [1-2]. Currently, different institutions are developing their own numerical tools regarding their scientific objective. These tools may have several different philosophies and thus cannot answer all the relevant issues of future nuclear fuel cycle.

Two methods for calculating the radionuclide inventory of discharged spent fuel for fuel cycle analysis includes using pre-calculated recipes and using cross sections.\n\nRecipes are tabulated sets of feed and discharge compositions for a given fuel irradiation history. They provide the \u201ctransfer coefficients\u201d that fuel cycle simulators need to convert mass flow radionuclide compositions for the feed fuel of a reactor into the mass flow radionuclide compositions of fuel discharged from the reactor. Recipes are calculated ahead of time using neutronics tools and then are input directly into the fuel cycle model. Although this approach works well for modeling fuel cycles with a fixed input and output composition (e.g., once-through LEU fuel cycles and simple single recycle scenarios) or fuel cycles already at equilibrium when compositions do not very significantly, it is difficult to accurately model more complex scenarios involving isotopic changes that occur during transition and on the approach to equilibrium. This includes changing from one fuel type to another or from one fuel cycle approach to another, such as transitioning from the current U.S. LWR fleet to a fleet of sodium fast cooled reactors.\n\nUsing problem-specific cross-section libraries generated by neutronics depletion tools is the second method for calculating the radionuclide inventory of discharged spent fuel for fuel cycle analysis. Unlike the recipes approach, the output stream in the reactor model is dynamic and changes based on input stream radionuclide composition. Another advantage of using cross-section libraries within fuel cycle evaluation codes is that some fuel cycle simulators can perform on the fly cross-section interpolation routines that generate reactor-, cycle-, and scenario-specific production and destruction routes during the fuel cycle calculation. This provides a means to capture the effects of changes in the neutron flux spectrum and magnitude of isotopic concentrations and cross sections during in-core irradiation.\n\nStaff at ORNL has produced burnup-dependent cross-section libraries that can be used for the fuel cycles being evaluated in the DOE FCO campaign [1] including cross sections for thermal reactors (CANDU, BWR, PWR, MOX, MSR) and fast reactors (SFR).  These cross sections have been used in ORION, a nuclear fuel cycle simulator developed at NNL [2]. It will be demonstrated with ORION that though recipes work well for static systems such as once-through fuel cycle models and steady-state scenarios, cross sections provide a higher fidelity results that can capture changes in more dynamic systems such as complex scenarios involving the multi-reuse and isotopic changes that occur during the transition and on the approach to equilibrium.", "timestamp": "4/13/2017 14:50:49", "title": "Cross section versus recipes for fuel cycle transition analysis using ORION"}

These predictors are trained on a databank composed of 1000 PWR infinite assembly depletion calculations performed using the software MURE (MCNP Utility for Reactor Evolution) based on the transport code MCNP (Monte- Carlo N Particle). A scenario in which PWR MOXEUS models are also tested on a balancing scenario is presented. The complex evolution of MOXEUS fresh fuel isotopic composition during the scenario is highlighted. Finally, a sensitivity studies based on a set of fuel cycle simulations performed from a precise design of experiment has been done. This work shows preliminary results for plutonium stabilization and incineration capabilities in a fuel cycle composed by PWR.\n", "timestamp": "4/28/2017 7:51:52", "title": "Study of plutonium reprocessing in PWR with the CLASS tool"}

The implementation of this new reactor in the CLASS (Core Library for Advanced Scenario Simulation) software, a dynamic fuel cycle simulation code developed by CNRS in collaboration with IRSN, requires the development of specific physics models [3]. These models aim at predicting physical quantities such as multiplication factor, cross sections, flux or isotopic compositions. These predictors are used many times during the simulation. First, they are used to build fresh fuel according to the reactor characteristics. For instance, in case of reprocessing scenario, fresh fuel might be manufactured with any isotopic composition present into storages. Besides, these predictors are also used to calculate the depletion of all possible fuel compositions. Thus, they must be optimized on a criterion of computing time minimization while providing sufficiently accurate results. Therefore, predictors\u2019 development is based on a databank composed of many depletion Monte Carlo simulations.\nIn this framework, prior to developing these predictors a neutronic study of each reactor core design is needed to determine the behavior of the quantities of interest, such as cross sections. Thus, physics models are adapted to reactor specificities. For practical reasons, they are generally based on a simplified version of the reactor design and the impact of different simplifications on neutronic values has to be quantified.\nThis introductory paper presents one ASTRID-like SFR-CFV preliminary study that is currently performed before integrating the associated models into the CLASS code. The low sodium void effect core used is based on the 600 MWe French ASTRID concept developed by CEA with industrial partners [4]. The core, which is very heterogeneous, is composed of two radial parts: an inner and an outer core. There are two kinds of assemblies which alternate differently fertile and fissile areas.\nTo prepare the appropriate methodology for core simulations, infinite assembly calculations can be run. First of all, static and depletion Monte Carlo codes are used to adjust different quantities of interest (number of cycles, number of particles per cycle, number of time steps\u2026). Then, the impact of the fuel isotopic composition on the previous indicators must be evaluated. These Monte Carlo simulations are done with the MORET Monte Carlo code and the coupling between MORET code and VESTA software, both developed by IRSN. The main results and analysis will be presented in the proposed paper.", "timestamp": "4/10/2017 4:41:35", "title": "Preliminary studies for ASTRID-like SFR implementation in the CLASS code"}

This work is aimed at exploring the possibility (in resources and economic terms) of implementing reprocessing for MOX fabrication in countries with medium sized fleets.\n\nIn order to properly study this reprocessing strategy in a medium sized fleet, the case of Spain has been chosen as representative. Two groups of fuel cycle scenarios beyond the current status of the fuel cycle in this country have been simulated. They include life-extension of the current reactor fleet and reprocessing strategies that burn the maximum possible amount of the Pu mass generated in the cycle. The simulation of the scenarios has been performed with TR_EVOL code developed at CIEMAT, considering each Spanish nuclear reactor individually.\n\nThis work includes the assessment of the impact of different scenario hypotheses on the amount of Pu burned in the cycle, the gallery length required in the final disposal, the economic implications (for the fuel cycle and in the particular case of reprocessing and waste management), and the effect of variations in the price of natural uranium.\n\nResults show that the lifetime of the reactors has an impact in the possible reduction in the Pu amount. Besides, some scenarios show a shortage of Pu available for MOX fuel fabrication coming from the reprocessing of UO2 spent fuel. From the economics point of view, this work has verified that, for medium sized fuel cycle scenarios, the most important parameters are the reprocessing cost and the natural uranium price. Smaller impact in the comparison is also found for the cost of the final disposal and the possibility of valuing the surplus Pu and reprocessed uranium existing at the end of the cycle.", "timestamp": "4/3/2017 2:52:46", "title": "Analysis of reprocessing options for medium sized nuclear fleets"}

In the Evaluation and Screening phase [1], only equilibrium scenarios were considered for fuel cycles that were regarded as representative of a set of similar fuel cycle concepts. Each set of concepts represents a so-called Evaluation Group (EG). This work is based on a transition from the actual US nuclear fleet (EG01) to a steady state scenario of EG30. EG30 is a closed double strata scenario with light water and fast reactors. On one stratum, sodium fast reactors (SFRs) recycle their own transuranium elements (TRU). The SFRs also recycle the TRU produced by light water reactors (LWRs), which comprise the other stratum. The SFRs employ a blanket filled with natural uranium. The TRU produced by the SFR blanket is diluted with natural uranium to build the MOX fuel used in the LWRs. During the transition, both SFRs and LWRs are able to use low enriched uranium as a startup fuel. The TRU from the blanket can also been used as a filler to build the SFR MOX if needed.\n\nThis study aims to compare the transition calculation of a fixed deployment schedule performed with a recipe-based approach against one that employs in-simulation fuel fabrication and depletion modelisation. Both calculations were performed with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator [2]. The recipe-based approach required fixed material flows (the transition batches correspond to a mix between the TRU from both the SFR recycled fuel and the SFR blanket), as well as 5 consecutive reprocessing passes to reach equilibrium with regards to the SFR. In contrast the in-simulation modeling scenario features mixing of the different material streams according to their availability and the reactor requirements. This means that depletion calculations are performed for each loaded fuel set. These models have been specially computed based on the previous CLASS models [3,4]. The two different calculations will be compared, specially in term of transition speed, unused plutonium inventories, and loaded fuel composition.", "timestamp": "", "title": "Recipe vs. Model"}

Analytical studies of thorium-based fuel cycle deployment strategies can help determine the optimal approaches for a given thorium fuel cycle, and guide fuel cycle technology research and development.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to analyze the potential impacts on the management of used nuclear fuel (UNF) associated with deploying thorium-based fuels in Pressure Tube Heavy Water Reactors (PT\u2011HWRs) in a once through fuel cycle.  The fuels that were analyzed are:\n\n\u00b7       a reference low-burnup (~7.2 MWd/kg) natural uranium (NU) fuel,\n\n\u00b7       an intermediate-burnup (~19.1 MWd/kg) fuel composed of 1.2 wt.% 235U/U slightly enriched uranium (SEU) combined with small amounts of thorium (95 wt.% SEU, 5 wt.% Th).\n\n\u00b7       a high-burnup  (~40.6 MWd/kg) fuel composed of 5.0 wt.% 235U/U low enriched uranium (LEU) mixed with thorium (~48 wt.% LEU, ~52 wt.% Th).\n\nThe scenario involves the deployment of these fuels in a fleet of PT\u2011HWRs, with a total installed capacity equal to that of all PT\u2011HWRs in Canada in 2014 (~13,512 MWe (net)), for a period of 60 years.  All UNF is to be ultimately placed in a deep geological repository (DGR) that is similar to the Canadian DGR concept for all PT\u2011HWR UNF in Canada.  Any UNF that has been removed from wet storage was temporarily placed in dry storage until it could be sent to the DGR.\n\nThe UNF management metrics that were analyzed include:\n\n\u00b7       the number of MACSTOR dry storage fuel baskets required to store UNF that has been removed from wet storage, but cannot be immediately loaded into the DGR; and\n\n\u00b7       the number of Canadian DGR used fuel containers (UFCs) loaded with UNF.\n\nThese metrics reflect the cost and footprint of the respective UNF management facilities.  In this analysis the total amount of UNF that can be placed in either a dry storage fuel basket or a DGR UFC cannot exceed a given number of fuel bundles and a maximum total decay power.\n\nThe results of this analysis show that the NU fuel required the fewest dry storage baskets due to its low decay power relative to the other fuels.  The intermediate -burnup SEU+Th fuel required the fewest number of DGR UFCs.  The high-burnup LEU+Th fuel also required fewer DGR UFCs than the NU fuel.", "timestamp": "4/11/2017 13:37:18", "title": "Scenario Analysis of PT\u2011HWR Used Fuel Management for Once-Through Thorium Fuel Cycles"}

As an example, either fast reactors come to start or not the final situation should be bearable in term of waste toxicity (including plutonium in the worst case). In a prospective study, there is no one solution to such an issue but more likely a tendency as a lot of parameters (cooling time, fuel burn-up, fraction of MOx fuelled reactors\u2026) has to be considered.\n\nIn order to cope with this problematic, a new scenario methodology has been developed. Each scenario is defined by a set of parameters. Typically, it is the composition of the fleet (rector number, power share\u2026), the characteristics of the fuel (UOx, MOx, MOxAm) or reactors (burn-up, loading factor\u2026) and the options of the fuel cycle (Cooling time of spent fuel, Storage, reprocessing strategy\u2026).
